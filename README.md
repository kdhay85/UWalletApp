The app provides convenient access to campus facilities and services, improving security and user experience.

- **NFC Integration**: Host Card Emulation (HCE), MyHostApduService Java class
- **Database**: Firestore
- **Other Tools**: GitHub, Android Studio

## Simulated Campus Services System
To facilitate testing and integration of UWallet, we developed a simulated campus services system. 
This system emulates the functionality of campus services, including door access and point-of-sale (PoS) transactions, allowing us to validate the behavior of our application in a controlled environment. (Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JS)
